## This directive was developed from a demand of my friend Amandio Magalh√£es. It is a simple component that loads data when the screen scrolling reaches the bottom of the window

# How to use

1 - Add to the module component "nyx.components"
2 - On body add attribute "nyx-scroll"
3 - Inject the service on the controller "Paginate"
4 - Follow the example of the project.

# How to view this sample
